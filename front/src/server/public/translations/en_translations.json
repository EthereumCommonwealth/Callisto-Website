  "DescriptionWhatIsTitle": "What is a smart contract?",
  "DescriptionWhatIsFirstText": "Smart contracts have been one of the biggest terms used in crypto currency. What is a smart contract? The term smart contract is used for software code or a protocol that is used to contribute to, verify or implement the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts enable the performance of credible transactions without third parties, can be automatically initiated and are fully programmable. Smart contracts enable people to adopt and use or create Dapps or ICO’s.",
  "DescriptionWhatIsSecondText": "Certain hacking incidents have been reported, such as the DAO hack ($50 million USD worth of Ether), the Parity Multi Sig Wallet Hack (approximately $300M), and the recent Parity Freeze where some random user “accidentally” froze at least 513,000 Ether.",
  "DescriptionWhatIsThirdText": "There are dangers associated with the smart contract technology. With multi-million Dapps and ICO’s, some people intentionally do things that might harm the community. These things are only possible if there are flaws in the underlying smart contract code.",
  "DescriptionSecurityTitle": "Smart Contract Security Audit",
  "DescriptionSecurityFirstText": "Smart contract programming is a relatively new field, lacking in security standards, documentation and best practices. ",
  "DescriptionSecuritySecondText": "Smart contracts need to be programmed 100% accurately from the beginning, and be able to withstand years of hacking attempts.",
  "DescriptionSecurityThirdText": "Otherwise, it leads to disastrous consequences and losses of millions of dollars for your customers. Smart-contracts have to be thoroughly planned, must consider all logical permutations, accommodate all possible exceptions, and be meticulously implemented. If you get the order of code wrong (as in the case of The DAO hack), or forget to initialize something (as in the Parity Freeze) then you could have an ‘irreversible’ disaster on your hands, immortalized on the immutable blockchain. Blockchains evolve and newer smart-contract development platforms will come, but the problem with code security is an eternal issue in programming which will be always present. Security auditing of smart-contracts code is a necessary requirement for any project, be it an ICO or any other DApp, in order to be considered safe and ready to proceed with the exchange listing.",
  "DescriptionSolutionTitle": "the Solution?",
  "DescriptionSolutionFirstText": "Smart Contract Audit Department. Callisto Network offers smart contract audits free of charge. Callisto Network is fully compatible with Ethereum and the Ethereum Classic environment (in the Solidity language and the EVM). Smart contract developers can also create smart contracts, hosted on the Callisto Network Blockchain.",
  "DescriptionAudit": "Smart Contract Audit by the Callisto Security Department",
  "DescriptionAuditText": "What is the Callisto Security Department? Why does it matter? In short, the Callisto Network allocates treasury funds to pay for security auditors. As a result, security audits are free of charge for smart-contract developers and development teams. The benefit is that this reduces risk and smart contract vulnerabilities and increases the adoption of programmable blockchains for the whole crypto industry. So, how does it work?",

  "SmartDetailBottomText": "Smart contract audits on Callisto Network Platform are free of charge for developers. However, if you need to urgently prepare an audit or need the smart contract prioritized, the developer can make a deposit (minimal deposit amount is 10,000 CLO) into the special smart-contract, which will hold the funds during the audit. Upon completion of the audit, the developer receives the funds back and can sell the CLO, if desired. <br /> <br /> After the audit request has been created it will be viewed by the security manager. If the request meets the requirements, then the security manager notifies the auditors that the audit request is available for them to pick it up.",
  "SmartAuthorTitle": "What will the smart contracts auditors do?",
  "SmartAuthorDescription": "The main task of each security auditor is to review the code for security-related issues and prepare a report on any errors encountered after the audit is complete. ",
  "SmartAuthorBottom": "A minimum of three different auditors, community members and the security manager will review the smart contract, so that the auditors are dissuaded from concealing any errors found, or from trying to exploit them. <br /> <br /> After the security manager has completed the code verification and supplemented the report with a description of their findings, the security manager comments on the corresponding Github issue that the report is complete.",
  "SmartAuthorStepOne": "All work is coordinated through Github. If an audit request (issue) appears in the list, the auditors will pick it up.",
  "SmartAuthorStepTwo": "After the auditor has received the scope of work, he will estimate the time required to complete the smart-contract review. This depends on the complexity of the smart contract code.",

  "StakingDescriptionMoneyTitle": "How does one earn money with cold staking?",
  "StakingDescriptionMoneyText": "The Callisto cold staking protocol is written in Solidity, a smart contract programming language. The cold staking contract receives 20% of all mining rewards per block and distributes this amount among cold stakers in direct proportion to their stake.",

  "WorkflowSecondStep": "The cold staker cannot access their funds during the locking period.",
  "WorkflowThirdStep": "The longer a staker “stakes”, the higher the reward will be.",
  "WorkflowFourthStep": "After the locking period expires, there are three options for the cold staker: (1) claim the reward and continue staking, thus locking their funds for another month. (2) claim the reward and withdraw their entire stake, or (3) Do nothing.",
  "WorkflowFifthStep": "When a staker does nothing for a certain amount of time (1 year) after the locking period has ended, then they are considered inactive and are removed from the staking contract. The inactive stake is returned to the stakers address. No reward shall be paid to inactive stakers.",
  "WorkflowSixthStep": "Each staker can independently claim their reward at any time after the locking period. The staking reward depends on the total amount of CLO that is currently in the cold staking contract. As a result, each staker's reward depends on other stakers' stakes.",
  "WorkflowSeventhStep": "There is no minimum staking amount.",
  "WorkflowEighthStep": "A cold staker can only stake with their own deposit address. It is not possible to send rewards to someone else's address, or grant someone permission to claim the reward on your behalf.",
  "WorkflowNinethStep": "A cold staker does not need to run a node to stake. They only need to invoke the staking contract twice: once to make a deposit and again to claim the reward. The ClassicEtherWallet is sufficient for this procedure. ",
