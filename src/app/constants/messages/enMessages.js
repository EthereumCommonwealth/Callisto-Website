    DescriptionSecurityFirstText: `
      Smart Contract programming is relatively new to field, without
      many security standards, documentation, or best practices to follow.
    `,
    DescriptionSecuritySecondText: `
      Smart contracts need to be constructed 100% right in one shot, able
      to withstand years of security attacks.
    `,
    DescriptionSecurityThirdText: `
      Otherwise, it leads to a disastrous consequences and losses of
      millions of dollars  for your customers. Smart-contracts have to
      be extensively planned, considering all logical permutations,
      accommodating all possible exceptions, and meticulously implemented.
      Get the order of code wrong (as in the case of The DAO hack) or forget
      to initialize something (as in the Parity Freeze) and you could have
      an ‘unchangeable’ disaster on your hands, immortalized on the immutable
      blockchain. Blockchains evolve and newer smart-contract development
      platforms will come, but the problem of code security is an eternal
      issue in programming which will be always relevant. Security audit
      of smart-contract codes is a necessary requirement for any project,
      be it ICO or any other DApp, in order to be considered safe and
      ready to proceed to the exchange listing.

      Smart contract audit on Callisto Network Platform are Free of charge for
      developers. However if you need to prepare audit urgently or with higher
      priority The developer of the smart contract may make a deposit (minimal
      threshold is set as low as 10000 CLO) into a special smart-contract that
      will hold the funds during the audit. Upon completion of the audit, the
      developer of the smart-contract receives his funds back and can sell the
      CLO further.

      After the audit request has been created, it is viewed by the audit manager.
      If the request meets the requirements, then the auditing manager assigns
      that the audit request is available for auditors for picking.
