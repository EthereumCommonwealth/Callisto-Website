      Smart Contract programming is relatively new to field, without
      many security standards, documentation, or best practices to follow.

    DescriptionSecuritySecondText: `
      Smart contracts need to be constructed 100% right in one shot, able

    `,
    DescriptionSecurityThirdText: `
      Otherwise, it leads to a disastrous consequences and losses of
      millions of dollars  for your customers. Smart-contracts have to
      be extensively planned, considering all logical permutations,
      accommodating all possible exceptions, and meticulously implemented.
      Get the order of code wrong (as in the case of The DAO hack) or forget
      to initialize something (as in the Parity Freeze) and you could have
      an ‘unchangeable’ disaster on your hands, immortalized on the immutable
      blockchain. Blockchains evolve and newer smart-contract development
      platforms will come, but the problem of code security is an eternal
      issue in programming which will be always relevant. Security audit
      of smart-contract codes is a necessary requirement for any project,

      After CLO owner has deposited coins into the Staking Contract the funds
      are locked for a certain period of time (approximately 1 month).
    `,
    WorkflowSecondStep: `
      The Cold Staker can not access their funds during the locking period.
    `,
    WorkflowThirdStep: `
      The longer a staker is “staking”, the higher the reward is.
    `,
    WorkflowFourthStep: `
      After the period of locking has passed, a Cold Staker has two options:
      (1) claim the reward and continue staking, thus lock their funds for
      1 month again, or (2) claim the reward and withdraw entire stake.
    `,
    WorkflowFifthStep: `
      If a staker is inactive for a certain period of time (1 year) then
      they are considered to be inactive and are disposed from the staking
      contract. Inactive stake is paid back to the stakers address.
      Staking reward is not paid for inactive stakers.
    `,
    WorkflowSixthStep: `
      Each staker can independently claim their reward at any time after the
      locking period. The staking reward depends on the amount of CLO that
      are currently in the Cold Staking Contract. As a result, the reward of
      each staker depend on other stakers claims.
    `,
    WorkflowSeventhStep: `
      There is no minimum staking threshold.
    `,
    WorkflowEighthStep: `
      A Cold Staker can only stake with their deposit address. There is no
      possibility to point rewards into someone else's address  or grant someone
      a permission to claim the reward on your behalf.
    `,
    WorkflowNinethStep: `
      A Cold Staker does not need to run a node to stake. They only need to
      invoke the staking contract twice: make a deposit and claim the reward.
      The ClassicEtherWallet is sufficient for this procedure.
