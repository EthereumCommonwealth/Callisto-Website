      Smart contract has been one of the biggest term used in
      cryptocurrency. What is smart contract? Term smart contract
      is used for code/protocol that used to contribute, verify or
      implement the negotiation or performance of the contract. Smart
      contracts allow to perform credible transactions without third
      parties, can be automatically triggered and fully programmable.

      Some disaster like hacking, has been reported like TheDAO hack
      (US$50 million-worth of Ether), Parity Multi Sig Wallet Hack

    DescriptionSecurityTitle: 'Smart Contract Security Audit',
    DescriptionSecurityFirstText: `
      Smart Contract programming is relatively new to field, without
      many security standards, documentation, or best practices to follow.
    `,
    DescriptionSecuritySecondText: `
      Smart contracts need to be constructed 100% right in one shot, able
      to withstand years of security attacks.
    `,
    DescriptionSecurityThirdText: `
      Otherwise, it leads to a disastrous consequences and losses of
      millions of dollars  for your customers. Smart-contracts have to
      be extensively planned, considering all logical permutations,
      accommodating all possible exceptions, and meticulously implemented.
      Get the order of code wrong (as in the case of The DAO hack) or forget
      to initialize something (as in the Parity Freeze) and you could have
      an ‘unchangeable’ disaster on your hands, immortalized on the immutable
      blockchain. Blockchains evolve and newer smart-contract development
      platforms will come, but the problem of code security is an eternal
      issue in programming which will be always relevant. Security audit
      of smart-contract codes is a necessary requirement for any project,
      be it ICO or any other DApp, in order to be considered safe and
      ready to proceed to the exchange listing.

      What is Callisto Security Department? Why it’s Matter? For a Simple
      Answer, Callisto Network deploys treasury funds to pay security
      auditors for their work, thus security audits are free-of-charge for
      smart-contract developers or development teams and the benefit for this
      is to reduce risk/flaw in smart contract and improve the adoption of
      programmable blockchains for the whole crypto industry. So, how its work?
